//Arduino Mega and Leonardo chips only support some pins for receiving data back from the RoboClaw
//This is because only some pins of these boards support PCINT interrupts or are UART receivers.
//Mega: 0,10,11,12,13,14,15,17,19,50,51,52,53,A6,A7,A8,A9,A10,A11,A12,A13,A14,A15
//Leonardo: 0,8,9,10,11

//Arduino Due currently does not support SoftwareSerial. Only hardware uarts can be used, pins 0/1, 14/15, 16/17 or 18/19.

//Note: Most Arduinos do not support higher baudrates rates than 115200.  Also the arduino hardware uarts generate 57600 and 115200 with a
//relatively large error which can cause communications problems.

//See BareMinimum example for a list of library functions
